# Word Embeddings using Keras Embedding Layer

This is a step-by-step approach to creating word embeddings using the Keras Embedding layer within a neural network. The Keras Embedding layer learns the word vectors as part of the model training process, making it a powerful and efficient way to generate embeddings.

## Steps Involved

### 1. **Importing Required Libraries**  
   First, we need to import the necessary libraries to build our model.

### 2. **Preparing the Data**  
   Load your text data and preprocess it for the neural network:
   - Tokenize the text into words.
   - Convert the words into sequences of integers.
   - Pad the sequences to ensure uniform input size.

### 3. **Defining the Model**  
   Create a sequential model and add the embedding layer. This layer will learn the embeddings during training.
   
### 4. **Compiling the Model**  
   Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.

### 5. **Training the Model**  
   Fit the model on your training data. During this process, the embedding layer learns to map words to their corresponding vectors.

### 6. **Extracting the Word Embeddings**  
   After training, the learned embeddings can be accessed from the embedding layer.
